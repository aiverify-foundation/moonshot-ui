<b>Motivation </b>

Developed by the [AI Verify Foundation](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=20230607_AI_Verify_Foundation_GitHub), [Moonshot](https://aiverifyfoundation.sg/project-moonshot/?utm_source=Github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=20230607_Queries_from_GitHub) is one of the first tools to bring Benchmarking and Red-Teaming together to help AI developers, compliance teams and AI system owners <b>evaluate LLMs and LLM applications</b>.

Project Moonshot's UI is designed to provide a more intuitive user experience for benchmarking and red teaming processes via [Moonshot Library](https://pypi.org/project/aiverify-moonshot/).

You can view the Project Moonshot Library Repository [here](https://github.com/aiverify-foundation/moonshot).
