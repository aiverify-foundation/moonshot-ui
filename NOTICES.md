  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of the Derivative Works; and

  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
    attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those
    notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least
    one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of
    the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided
    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have
executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required
for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.

    pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
    arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or
    phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any
    other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including
    in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose
    of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

  b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
    other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below,
    which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,
    constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
    entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each
    constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
    assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will
    not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
    License.

  c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies
    of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of
    ownership.

  d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.

  e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the
    individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no
    individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in
    the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other
    persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise
    perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
    case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first
    fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
    broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

  f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of
    this License including without limitation any production in the literary,
    scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its
    expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
    writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
    dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in
    dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic
    work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture,
    engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an
    illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to
    geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a
    phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a
    copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to
    the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.

  g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who
    has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the
    Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise
    rights under this License despite a previous violation.

  h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to
    communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process,
    including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make
    available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may
    access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them;
    to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the
    communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by
    public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
    means including signs, sounds or images.

  i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without
    limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
    reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
    performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.

2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or
restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection
under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work
as stated below:

  a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections,
    and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;

  b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly
    label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
    Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
    translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
    original work has been modified.";

  c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in
    Collections; and,

  d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

  e. 

    For the avoidance of doubt:

      i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
        licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
        right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights
        granted under this License;

      ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which
        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory
        licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right
        to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
        under this License; and,

      iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
        royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a
        member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing
        schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted
        under this License.

The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications
as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats.
Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby
reserved.

4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
to and limited by the following restrictions:

  a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this
    License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
    for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
    terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise
    the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may
    not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
    License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
    Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work
    that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the
    rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section
    4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
    require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the
    terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any
    credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section
    4(b), as requested.

  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section
    4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
    (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author
    and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
    Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the
    Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
    does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a
    credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French
    translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original
    Work by Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of
    a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
    for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as
    part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits
    for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You
    may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
    sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
    Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
    the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise
    permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform
    the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You
    must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in
    relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
    honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g.
    Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this
    License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the
    Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
    under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
    otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS
THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING
THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION
MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS
LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

  a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically
    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities
    who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License,
    however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
    entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
    7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

  b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;
    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

  a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the
    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

  b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers
    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.

  c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the
    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the
    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum
    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.

  d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by
    the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

  e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or
    representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
    not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any
    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual
    written agreement of the Licensor and You.

  f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License
    were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
    Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979),
    the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO
    Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are
    sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If
    the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes
    additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are
    deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
    restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

Creative Commons Corporation (“Creative Commons”) is not a law firm and does not
provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of Creative Commons public
licenses does not create a lawyer-client or other relationship. Creative Commons
makes its licenses and related information available on an “as-is” basis.
Creative Commons gives no warranties regarding its licenses, any material

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions
that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of
authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights
specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for
informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our
licenses.

Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those
authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise
restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable.
Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they
choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary
before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as
expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license.
This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an exception or
limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors.

Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor
grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms
and conditions. If the licensor’s permission is not necessary for any reason–for
example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright–then that
use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under
copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including
because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may
make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those
requests where reasonable. More considerations for the public.

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor
grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that
is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed
Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in
a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a
musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always
produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving
image.

b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar
Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely
related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound
recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are
labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified
in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of
proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under
Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or
similar international agreements.

e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar
Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has
authority to license.

h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this
Public License.

i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that
requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from
Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996
on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as
other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this
Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

a. License grant.

1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive,
irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and
Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not
need to comply with its terms and conditions.

3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes
You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or
hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You
from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications
authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.

5. Downstream recipients.

A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed
Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.

B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or
different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures
to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights
by any recipient of the Licensed Material.

6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed
as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed
Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status
by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in
Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. Other rights.

1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality
rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to
allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties
from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a
collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to
collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

a. Attribution.

1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed
Material:

i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others
designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the
Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);

ii. a copyright notice;

iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably
practicable;

B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any
previous modifications; and

C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and
include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.

2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner
based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material.
For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required
by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply
must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this
Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the
database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is
Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
substantial portion of the contents of the database.
For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your
obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other
Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and
makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed
Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without
limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the
presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where
disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may
not apply to You.

b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any
legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any
direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or
other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or
use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the
possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to
You.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall
be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your
rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
6(a), it reinstates:

1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at
any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the
Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this
Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary
to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed
from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining
terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to
comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the
Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or
authority.

Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative
Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes

==================================


Creative Commons Legal Code
---------------------------


CC0 1.0 Universal
-----------------

CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL
SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT
RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS.
CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE
INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
HEREUNDER.


Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship
and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to
the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater
distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work
(the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected
by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights").
Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
    and translate a Work;

  ii.  moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
    depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject
    to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a
    Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
    European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
    protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
    including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
    based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or
unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
the Work

  i.  in all territories worldwide,

  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions),

  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and

  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver").

Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large
and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that
such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express
Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall
be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged
Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable,
non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work

  i.  in all territories worldwide,

  ii.  for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including
    future time extensions),

  iii.  in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and

  iv.  for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
    advertising or promotional purposes (the "License").

The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer
to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such
case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not

  i.  exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the
    Work or

  ii.  assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
    Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
    surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of
    any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
    including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
    for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other
    defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
    discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that
    may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
    person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
    disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or
    other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party
    to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or
    use of the Work.

2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------


  2.1. Grants

  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
  license:

    a. 

      under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,
      display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions,
      either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger

    b. 

      under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
      have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its
      Contributor Version.


  2.2. Effective Date

  The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
  effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
  such Contribution.


  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

  The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this
  License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
  or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding
  Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

    a. 

      for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

    b. 

      for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or

    c. 

      under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
      Contributions.

  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
  logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
  requirements in Section 3.4).


  2.4. Subsequent Licenses

  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute
  the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see
  Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the
  terms of Section 3.3).


  2.5. Representation

  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
  its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
  Contributions conveyed by this License.


  2.6. Fair Use

  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
  copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.


  2.7. Conditions

  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
  Section 2.1.


3. Responsibilities
-------------------


  3.1. Distribution of Source Form

  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
  obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the
  recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.


  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    a. 

      such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
      described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable
      Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable
      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution
      to the recipient; and

    b. 

      You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
      sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
      Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
      in the Source Code Form under this License.


  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
  a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
  not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
  additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary
  License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,
  further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
  or such Secondary License(s).


  3.4. Notices

  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
  liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy
  known factual inaccuracies.


  3.5. Application of Additional Terms

  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
  indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
  agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
  offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
  liability specific to any jurisdiction.


4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.


5. Termination
--------------

  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
  fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
  the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
  finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
  grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this
  is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
  receipt of the notice.

  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
  cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
  Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall
  terminate.

  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
  termination shall survive termination.


6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without
limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any
Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume
the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered
Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.


7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility
of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for
death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
and limitation may not apply to You.


8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference
to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a
party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.


9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against
a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License
---------------------------


  10.1. New Versions

  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3,
  no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
  versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
  number.


  10.2. Effect of New Versions

  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
  License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
  terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.


  10.3. Modified Versions

  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
  new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
  this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of
  the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from
  this License).


  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses

  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice
  described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
